"""Standalone refresher subprocess for credential_strategy="short-lived" jobs.

Forked by runner.py (via storage_credentials_client.spawn_refresher) right after the initial
credential mint, before process_class.run() is invoked. Runs for the lifetime of the job: sleeps
until roughly half the current credential's remaining lifetime, re-mints via the backend's
internal refresh endpoint, and writes the result to CREDENTIALS_FILE for the main process to pick
up on its next storage access (storage_credentials_client.RefreshableStorageKwargs).

See docs/plans/done/short-lived-storage-credentials-04-runner-refresh-loop.md section 4.3/4.4.
