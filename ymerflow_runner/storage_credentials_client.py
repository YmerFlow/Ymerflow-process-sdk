"""Shared between runner.py and storage_credential_refresher.py.

For credential_strategy="short-lived" jobs, the pod's env vars are only a starting point — the
credential they carry expires mid-job, and env vars of an already-running process can't be
updated. So the refresher subprocess (storage_credential_refresher.py) re-mints periodically and
writes the result to a well-known local file; the main process reads that file on every storage
access instead of trusting its startup env vars. This is what makes storage_context's
`storage_kwargs` need to be "live" rather than a plain dict computed once at startup — see
docs/plans/done/short-lived-storage-credentials-04-runner-refresh-loop.md section 4.3.

For credential_strategy="static-key" (the default) none of this is used: runner.py's
get_storage_kwargs() keeps returning a plain dict exactly as before.
